# Webstack Monitoring
Software monitoring will watch computer metrics, record them, and emit an alert if something is unusual or that could make the computer not work properly happens.

Server monitoring can have different objectives and track different key performance indicators (KPIs) based on the type of server, but the primary objective of server monitoring is always to protect the server from possible failure that would interrupt service availability.


Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

* Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
* Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)
